# Bayesian inference: specifying a prior distribution

In this activity, we will guide you in specifying your own 
Bayesian prior distribution for a discrete parameter. 

## Directory roadmap

- `BayesPriorActivity.docx` contains the activity sheet with exercises.
- `histogram.Rmd` is the shiny App required to complete the activity.
You can compile the app locally by forking this repository,
or access a compiled version online in the following link:
